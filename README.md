# MultiThreadingProject

This is a project used to try multithreading in c++
The user chooses a number (any size) which then gets converted to binary.
The program will then check all numbers previous to that number to see if any other numbers have the same amount
of one's(1's) in their binary format. If a number does, then it's a match.
The program will then print out the number of matches that it found.

to use this program, run it and then enter the number you want to check, followed by -1
for example: 2746464 -1
